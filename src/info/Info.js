I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything

of what each of the values mean.
